A long time ago, in a garden far far away

Last January, I started searching for tools to help me grow my garden.  I'm a
lazy software hacker by profession, and a planner by nature.  I wanted tools to
help me create a garden calendar and plot out my garden, and some electronics to
automatically water my plants in the summer.

I never found any really good freely available tools, and certainly no open
source tools, so I gave up and started writing my own.  I ended up creating
several different projects, including an Android app called ColdSnap that
notifies of incoming frosts, a garden calendaring/todo list tool, and an
Arduino-based watering system, loosely based off the <a
href="http://garduino.dirtnail.com/">Garduino</a>.  You can find
those tools on <a href="http://github.com/sarahsharp/GardenGeek">github</a>.

This January, I presented my tools at Linux Conference Australia in a talk
called <a href="http://linuxconfau.blip.tv/file/4728591/">"Growing food with
Open Source"</a>.  I was amazed by the interest from the conference attendees,
and by how many people told me about geeky garden projects I had never heard of.
There was one person who told me they had already developed a project similar to
the Garduino, but they were too worried about being in front of an audience to
ever present it!

Of course, I wanted to keep in contact with all the awesome garden hackers at
LCA, and hear about any projects they were working on.  I realized there was no
online representation for this community, where people combine their technology
and science expertise with their passion for gardening.  So I created it.

Welcome to GardenGeek.org!

I hope you can contribute to this community, or use this site to find a cool
garden project to work on.
