What is GardenGeek.org?
======================

Some gardeners use a hose to water their garden.  Other gardeners hack together
open hardware Arduino boards to automatically water their plants.  Some
gardeners use a paper calendar to plan their garden, and other gardeners build
their own garden planning software that integrates with their Google calendar.
Some gardeners use a hoe to kill those pesky weeds.  Other gardeners build laser
rigs with plant image recognition that detects weeds and fries them dead.

If you find yourself in that "other" geeky gardener category, this community is
for you.  This is the place to find your next cool project, collaborate with
other garden geeks, or discuss the latest garden science breakthrough.
