[[!meta title="GardenGeek.org Community"]]

If you haven't noticed, GardenGeek.org is actually a wiki.  This means anyone
who registers can edit the pages, add content and links, correct mistakes, and
share their knowledge.  The goal is for GardenGeek.org to become the source of
knowledge about everything electronics and software that relates to gardening.

We know that a lot of wikis stagnate, get out of date, and get abandoned.
Conversations and information sharing tends to happen via email and on social
media websites instead.  That's why we've extended the GardenGeek.org
conversation to
<a href="http://twitter.com/gardengeekery">Twitter</a>,
<a href="http://identi.ca/gardengeekery">Identica</a>,
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/GardenGeekery/">Facebook</a>,
and
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/GardenGeekery">Google groups</a>

Want to send us a quick link before you forget about it?  Send it via social
media.  We'll update the wiki with content provided from social media websites
as time permits.

Want more in depth help with a cool project, want to throw around some ideas, or
have a longer discussion with fellow garden geeks?  We suggest you join the <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/garden-geekery">Garden Geekery</a> Google Group (try saying that five times fast) and send us an email.
