[How to build a simple soil moisture
sensor](http://www.cheapvegetablegardener.com/2009/11/how-to-make-cheap-soil-moisture-sensor-2.html).
It doesn't get any simpler than this!  Two nails, some plastic tubing, wire, wax
paper, and plaster of paris can create a really cheap soil moisture sensor.
Very easy to make, although you may have issues with soldering the wire contacts
on the galvanized nails.  You can use hot glue, but you may lose some
conductivity.

Garduio = Gardening + Arduino.  Use an Arduino to automatically water your
plants and monitor temperature and sunlight.  The original instructables
documentation is
[here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Garduino-Gardening-Arduino/).  You can
also purchase an Arduino shield kit on
[dirtnail.com](http://garduino.dirtnail.com/)  The schematics and code are
available, although the website owner didn't answer my email about what license
they were available under (assume proprietary?).  The instructables tutorial is
under the share-alike attribution Creative Commons license, so please use that.

There are many people who seem to have created Garduino-like projects:
* [Mention in 2008 on the Arduino forums](http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1212611752/1)
* [Garden Bot](http://gardenbot.org/)
