[How to build a simple soil moisture
sensor](http://www.cheapvegetablegardener.com/2009/11/how-to-make-cheap-soil-moisture-sensor-2.html).
It doesn't get any simpler than this!  Two nails, some plastic tubing, wire, wax
paper, and plaster of paris can create a really cheap soil moisture sensor.
Very easy to make, although you may have issues with soldering the wire contacts
on the galvanized nails.  You can use hot glue, but you may lose some
conductivity.
