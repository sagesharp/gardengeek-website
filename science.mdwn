Peas Inoculant Science
======================

Peas (such as snap peas, snow peas, or shelling peas) are co-dependent on a
particular type of soil bacteria called <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizobia">rhizobia</a>.  This bacteria can
only live within a plant's roots (the nodules).  The rhizobia fixes nitrogen
into the soil, and the host in turn grows better and produces more peas with the
increased nitrogen.  When the peas die off in the winter, they leave behind
their decaying root structures, with dormant nodules.  Next year's generation of
peas will be even more productive than the last because of those nodules, <a
href="http://www4.agr.gc.ca/resources/prod/doc/pfra/csidc/pea-pois_eng.pdf">as
this paper shows.</a>

What does this mean for a gardener who wants to start peas in a new plot?  If no
peas have been grown in the area, there will be no rhizobia to help feed the new
peas nitrogen.  Fortunately, you can mix in some soil from a previous spot where
peas grew to add some native rhizobia.  If you haven't ever grown peas, there
are commercial rhizobial "inoculants" that you can apply to the soil to help the
peas in their first year.

There are several different kinds of commercial inoculants: liquid, granular,
and powdered peat inoculant.  <a
href="http://ginkgo.cisti.nrc.ca/RPAS/rpv?hm=HInit&journal=cjss&volume=80&afpf=S99-059.pdf">This
paper</a> discusses the results of applying those inoculants to soil with
different pH levels.  You might figure out what soil type you have</a> and use
that information to pick which type of inoculant you use.


Soil Type Test
==============

Soil is just soil, right?  Wrong.  Soil is actually a mixture of different sized
particles: clay, sand, and silt.  If you've ever tried to dig a hole and bent
your shovel, you've probably encountered soil with a high clay composition.  <a
href="http://razorfamilyfarms.com/gardening/soil-composition/">This post</a> has
a good basic description of soil composition, and explains why some soil types
are better than others.

The awesome thing is that a home gardener can do a simple test with a glass jar
to determine what soil type they have.  <a
